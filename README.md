**Intern ID**: CT04WZ133  
**Domain**: Full Stack Web Development  
**Duration**: 4 Weeks  
**Mentor**: Neela Santosh  

## Project Description

The **Weather App – API Integration Project** is a web-based application developed as part of a Full-Stack Web Development internship. This project focuses on integrating third-party APIs to fetch real-time data and display it in a user-friendly interface. The weather application utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather information and presents it to users dynamically based on their input.

### Features

#### 1. Dynamic API Integration
- The app fetches **real-time weather information** from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
- The app displays city-specific data such as:
  - **Temperature** (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
  - **Weather conditions** (e.g., clear skies, rain, snow, etc.).
  - **Humidity** level as a percentage.
  - **Wind speed** at the location.

#### 2. Responsive Design
- Built with a **mobile-first approach** to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Uses **CSS** and **Flexbox** for a flexible and adaptive layout.
- The app works well on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

#### 3. Error Handling
- **User-friendly error messages** for invalid input or API errors.
- Displays clear feedback when a user enters an invalid city name or when there is an issue with the API.

#### 4. Interactive and Modern UI
- Clean, modern, and visually appealing interface.
- Uses **Google Fonts** for typography, **CSS gradients**, and **shadows** for a professional look.
- Features smooth transitions and animations to enhance user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: The basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For API integration, data manipulation, and DOM updates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a **city name** and clicks the “**Get Weather**” button.
2. **API Fetch**: The app makes a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather data for the specified city.
3. **Displaying Data**: The weather data, such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed, is displayed dynamically.
4. **Error Handling**: If the city name is invalid or there’s an issue with the API, an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-API Integration**: Add additional APIs for news, 7-day weather forecasts, or other data.
- **Autocomplete Feature**: Implement city name autocomplete for easier input.
- **7-Day Weather Forecast**: Display weather for the next seven days to provide more information.
- **Geo-Location Support**: Fetch weather data based on the user’s current location.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode for users who prefer a low-light interface.

## Conclusion

The **Weather App – API Integration** project demonstrates the integration of an external API (OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display real-time weather data in a dynamic, user-friendly interface. It meets the requirements for API integration, responsive design, and error handling. The project is a great starting point for learning more about full-stack web development, API integration, and real-time data handling.

With further improvements, this app can be expanded to include more features and become a powerful weather tool for users.
