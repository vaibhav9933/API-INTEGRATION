# Project Decsription.....
Weather App â€“ API Integration Project
This project is a responsive weather application built as part of a Full-Stack Web Development internship. The objective is to demonstrate API integration by fetching and dynamically displaying real-time data from a public API. The application fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in an intuitive and responsive user interface.

**Features**

1. Dynamic API Integration:

 Real-time weather information fetched via the OpenWeatherMap API.

 Displays city-specific data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind 
 speed.

2. Responsive Design:

 Designed with a mobile-first approach using CSS and Flexbox.

 Ensures compatibility with desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

3.Error Handling:

 User-friendly messages for invalid input or API errors.

4.Interactive and Modern UI:

 Clean design with gradients, shadows, and smooth transitions.

 Styled using Google Fonts and CSS for a visually appealing experience.

Tech Stack

1.HTML: Structure of the webpage.

2.CSS: Styling and responsiveness.

3.JavaScript: API integration and DOM manipulation.

4.OpenWeatherMap API: Data source for weather details.

How It Works

1.Users input a city name and click the "Get Weather" button.

2.The app fetches weather data from the API and displays it dynamically.

3.If input is invalid, appropriate error messages are shown.

Future Improvements

Expand functionality to include additional APIs (e.g., news or forecast data).

Add autocomplete for city names.

Implement features like a 7-day weather forecast.

Conclusion

This project successfully meets the criteria of API integration and responsive design, showcasing fundamental web development skills. It serves as a strong foundation for future enhancements and learning.
